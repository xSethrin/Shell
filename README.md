# Shell
Shell assignment written in C

AUTHORS:
Nikolo Sperberg
Sterling Rohlinger 

READ_ME:
This assignment we made a shell program. To use the background process the “&” 
must be separated from the command by a space or the file will not recognize the format. 
We also prevent the user from entering no commands. We included our test file for a background process. 

FILE_CONTENT:
demo1.png
demo2.png
shell.c
test.c
foo.txt
test.txt

NOTES:
***In demo2.png we used commands used redirected output to foo.txt and test.txt. These files have been included in the zip folder. 
***On our machine we are only able to view the images (.png) in paint. 
***The wrong pid will sometimes print to the console.
